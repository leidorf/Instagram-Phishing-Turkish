**- My Instagram phishing page is really easy to use, you only have to replace WEBHOOK on line 199 by your Discord webhook :**<br/>

**- Next you upload it in your website (like netlify or 000webhost, they are free)**<br>
**- When someone will login you will receive his credentials and he will be redirected to a funny video on Instagram for example.**<br/>
**- You can edit the redirection link by editing it on line 210 in the js part in HTML code.**<br/>
